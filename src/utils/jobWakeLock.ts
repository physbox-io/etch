/**
 * Keeps the computer awake while a job is on the machine.
 *
 * A laptop left beside the machine for an hour's cut goes to sleep on its own
 * schedule. Sleep suspends USB, the serial port closes under the stream, and
 * the controller runs its buffer dry and stops partway through the job, with
 * the part half-cut and the origin trusted to nobody. A screen wake lock is
 * the one thing a web page can do about that.
 *
 * What it does *not* fix is a backgrounded tab, and it is not meant to: the
 * browser drops the lock whenever the page is hidden. That is harmless here
 * because the stream is paced by the controller's `ok`s arriving on the serial
 * reader, not by timers, so tab throttling does not starve it. The lock is
 * asked for again when the page becomes visible.
 *
 * Held for the whole of a job, pauses included: a tool change is exactly when
 * the operator walks away from the keyboard, and a machine that sleeps then
 * cannot be resumed.
